#  Windows Defender Bypass & Reverse Shell Dropper

This script is designed to run on a Digispark/Arduino Leonardo-style USB device that emulates a keyboard. It disables Windows Defender, elevates privileges via PowerShell, downloads a remote shell payload, and establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote host.

---

##  Features

- Opens Windows Defender threat settings and attempts to disable protection
- Elevates to admin PowerShell via UAC bypass
- Downloads a reverse shell payload (`nc64.exe`)
- Executes the shell in a hidden/minimized command prompt
- Connects back to a remote listener

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Digispark or Arduino Leonardo/Micro with USB HID support
- Arduino IDE
- `Keyboard.h` library
- Local reverse shell listener (e.g., `nc -lvnp 4444` on attacker's machine)
- HTTP server hosting `nc64.exe` at `http://<IP>/nc64.exe`

---

## üß™ Usage

1. Flash the code onto a compatible Digispark or HID-enabled Arduino board.
2. Plug the device into the target system.
3. Reverse shell will be attempted and connected to the IP `<IP>` on port `4444`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Disclaimer

This tool is meant for **authorized** penetration testing, red teaming, or educational purposes only. Using this code against machines you do not own or have explicit written permission to test may violate laws and regulations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Potential Improvements

Here are a few enhancements or changes you could implement:

1. **Error Handling / Checkpoints:**
   - Use `timeout`/`try`/`catch` logic in the PowerShell script to detect if a command fails or is blocked.

2. **Stealth Enhancements:**
   - Obfuscate the PowerShell commands (`iex`, `Base64`, etc.)
   - Minimize all windows after execution to hide evidence.

3. **Dynamic Payload Delivery:**
   - Generate a randomized folder and file name for payload storage.
   - Use HTTPS and domain names instead of IPs for command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.

4. **UAC Bypass Variants:**
   - Use alternate bypass techniques (e.g., `fodhelper.exe`, `eventvwr.exe`) for privilege escalation.

5. **Payload Persistence:**
   - Add logic to establish persistence (e.g., adding to startup or registry).

6. **Reduce Static Delays:**
   - Use conditional waits, like checking for window titles or system responses, instead of static `delay()` times.

7. **Evade Defender Smarter:**
   - Consider registry-level disabling of Defender features using PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
     ```

## üîê Security Reminder

This project showcases the power of USB HID devices for red teaming but also the severe risks they pose if misused. Always operate within ethical and legal boundaries.
